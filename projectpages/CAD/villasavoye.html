          As we were recreating the Villa Savoye on 3ds max we also wrote an article about it, based off of 'ICON' magazines style using Indesign. <br> <br> The article reads:

          ​
          
          Villa Savoye. This name brings about a lot of different opinions when mentioned from its significance in the architectural world to its controversies with its living standards. It was intended to be a modernist villa in Poissy, France, country home to Pierre and Eugenie Savoye (a wealthy French insurer and his wife). But, over time humans have found an array of uses for it. As a result of a world war and due to the fact that the materials used/method of construction was not designed for structural durability it ruled it uninhabitable, leaving it open to the opportunity for others to explore it in their own way.
          
          The Savoye family commissioned Charles-Édouard Jeanneret, also known as Le Corbusier, a French-Swiss and his cousin Pierre Jeanneret to design the building. Designed and built between 1929 and 1931 it represents one of the first examples of modern architecture. They redefined traditional ideas of architecture and construction, Le Corbusier used the site to test out a set of principles he’d formulated called ‘The five points of new architecture’ which sets out five rules the Corbusier believed could be applied to any architectural site, such as; Pilotis (the building is to be lifted off of the ground by load-bearing columns to reserve the ground for cars to move and the garden to continue through), free plan (as the columns carry the weight the walls can go with the natural flow of the space), free façade (the structure, on the ground floor, is separated from the facade, as it is no longer load-bearing, as there are pilotis, also allowing the floor to be shaped in any form), horizontal windows (the non-load bearing facade can be cut all the way along as a window, allowing light to enter panoramically giving maximum clarity into and out of the space) and roof garden (a house should give back to the land it took from by having a roof garden).
          
          
          
          Within the book, Le Corbusier praises science, engineering technology, and argues that modern machines, in those days, such as; cars, airplanes and factories were very efficient and created highly precise objects. A reason as to why he designed the villa with the idea of it being ‘a machine for living’. The ground floor took inspiration from the turning circle of a 1927 Citroen, the machine that would be using the space, allowing it to easily manoeuvre to the front door where arriving guests had easy access to the entrance and into the integrated garage. The ground floor walls are recessed and painted green so that the house looks like a box floating on delicate columns.
          
          
          
          The Villa Savoye was only inhabited until 1940 as many problems arose with the construction of it, making it uncomfortable to live in. The Savoye’s wrote several letters to Le Corbusier outlining the many faults with building, such as; a continuously leaking roof, skylight that made a terrible noise that prevented the occupants from sleeping, bad retention of warmth due to the large windows, dampness, caused the owner’s son to become ill resulting in the unhappiness of the family. The home was first abandoned at the start of the Second World War.
          
           So what could this building be used for? During World War II it was occupied twice; once by the Germans (who looted it) and the second time by Americans (who used it as a hay store), both occupations severely damaged the building, resulting in a renovation of around $80,000 so the Savoye’s completely abandoned it in 1945. The town of Poissy ended up using the building as a youth centre in 1958, when it became the property of the French state, later it was suggested to demolish it but survived as people believed it was a significant piece of architecture because of its history and impact it had had on modern architecture.
          
          Bernard Tschumi, in his 1976 article "Architecture and Transgression" records visiting the villa in its state of vandalism and disrepair. "Those who in 1965 visited the then derelict Villa Savoye certainly remember the squalid walls of the small service rooms on the ground floor, stinking of urine, smeared with excrement, and covered with obscene graffiti."
          
          The first attempt at restoring the abandoned building was begun in 1963 by architect Jean Debuisson, although Le Corbusier was against this. The villa was added to the French register of historical monuments in 1965, becoming France's first modernist building to be designated as a historical monument, and also the first to be the object of restoration while its architect was still living. In 1985, a state-funded restoration led by architect Jean-Louis Véret was started. It was completed in 1997. The restoration included structural and surface repairs to the façades and terraces because of the deterioration of the concrete; the installation of lighting and security cameras; and the reinstatement of some of the original fixtures and fittings.
          
           Since 2016 it has been named a UNESCO world heritage site. Now acting as a tourist attraction, imitations can be found all over the world as it continues to inspire architects, such as E.B. Min of Min|Day architects who says ‘I think seeing the house in person made it much more apparent that, instead of a series of contained spaces, the house was really a continuous unfolding experience…The house reflects the impact of automobile travel, and how important ideas of speed and motion were at the time the house was designed…At the time that Villa Savoye was built, people’s ideas about space and time were changing radically. That’s evident even when you look at the house today.’
          
          In life things don’t always turn out as intended, shown here with the Villa Savoye as a location for various events has sprouted from this commission rather than a home. All at the expense of the Savoye family but a treasure to architects all around the globe that look to the building for inspiration or an example of what not to do.
